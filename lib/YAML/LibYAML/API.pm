YAML::LibYAML::API - Wrapper around the C libyaml library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use YAML::LibYAML::API::XS;

    my $version = YAML::LibYAML::API::XS::libyaml_version();

    my $yaml = <<'EOM';
    ---
    foo: &ALIAS bar
    'alias': *ALIAS
    tag: !!int 23
    list:

      literal
    EOM
    my $events = [];
    YAML::LibYAML::API::XS::parse_events($yaml, $events);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a thin wrapper around the C libyaml API. Currently it
only provides a function for getting a list of parsing events for an input
string. Functions for emitting and the document loading API are still todo.

C<libyaml-dev> has to be installed.
